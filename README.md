A bit about myself.  I like to roast coffee, then grind and make it into either Aeropress or espresso.  It's delicious and I rely on it to help me get up in the morning and get started with what needs to get done.  My favorites are the light roasts, since I'm tired of really strong roasty/charcoaly notes, especially when combined with stale/oxidized notes.
